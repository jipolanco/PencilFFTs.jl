# Below is the template to run your tests in Julia

  # Uncomment below if you would like to run the tests on specific references
  # only, such as the branches `master`, `development`, etc.
  # only:
  #   - master
  #   - development
  tags:
    - julia

  # Note: OpenMPI doesn't support running as root, unless --allow-run-as-root is
  # passed to mpirun. With MPICH there's no such problem.

# Name a test and select an appropriate image.
# images comes from Docker hub

# Note: test will only work starting from Julia 1.2, because of the way how test
# dependencies are specified (using a separate test/Project.toml file).
# See https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/creating-packages/#Test-specific-dependencies-in-Julia-1.2-and-above-1

# Right now latest = 1.3
# test:latest:
#   image: julia:latest
#   <<: *test_definition

test:1.3:
  image: julia:1.3
  <<: *test_definition

# Maybe you would like to test your package against the development branch:
# test:1.1-dev (not sure there is such an image in docker, so not tested yet):
#  image: julia:v1.1-dev
#  # ... allowing for failures, since we are testing against the development
#  # branch:
#  allow_failure: true
#  <<: *test_definition

# REMARK: Do not forget to enable the coverage feature for your project, if you
# are using code coverage reporting above. This can be done by
#
# - Navigating to the `CI/CD Pipelines` settings of your project,
# - Copying and pasting the default `Simplecov` regex example provided, i.e.,
#   `\(\d+.\d+\%\) covered` in the `test coverage parsing` textfield.

# Example documentation deployment
