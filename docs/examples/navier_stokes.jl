# # Navier--Stokes equations
#
# In this example, we numerically solve the incompressible Navier--Stokes
# equations
#
# ```math
# ∂_t \bm{v} + (\bm{v} ⋅ \bm{∇}) \bm{v} = -\frac{1}{ρ} \bm{∇} p + ν ∇^2 \bm{v},
# \quad \bm{∇} ⋅ \bm{v} = 0,
# ```
#
# where ``\bm{v}(\bm{x}, t)`` and ``p(\bm{x}, t)`` are respectively the velocity
# and pressure fields, ``ν`` is the fluid kinematic viscosity and ``ρ`` is the
# fluid density.
#
# We solve the above equations a 3D periodic domain using a standard Fourier
# pseudo-spectral method.

# ## First steps
#
# We start by loading the required packages, initialising MPI and setting the
# simulation parameters.

using MPI
using PencilFFTs

MPI.Init()
comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
procid = MPI.Comm_rank(comm) + 1

## Simulation parameters
Ns = (64, 64, 64)  # = (Nx, Ny, Nz)
Ls = (2π, 2π, 2π)  # = (Lx, Ly, Lz)

## Collocation points ("global" = over all processes).
## We include the endpoint (length = N + 1) for convenience.
xs_global = map((N, L) -> range(0, L; length = N + 1), Ns, Ls)  # = (x, y, z)

# Let's check the number of MPI processes over which we're running our
# simulation:
MPI.Comm_size(comm)

# We can now create a partitioning of the domain based on the number of grid
# points (`Ns`) and on the number of MPI processes.
# There are different ways to do this.
# For simplicity, here we do it automatically following the [PencilArrays.jl
# docs](https://jipolanco.github.io/PencilArrays.jl/stable/Pencils/#pencil-high-level):

pen = Pencil(Ns, comm)

# The subdomain associated to the local MPI process can be obtained using
# [`range_local`](https://jipolanco.github.io/PencilArrays.jl/dev/Pencils/#PencilArrays.Pencils.range_local-Tuple{Pencil,%20LogicalOrder}):

range_local(pen)

# We now construct a distributed vector field that follows the decomposition
# configuration we just created:

v⃗₀ = (
    PencilArray{Float64}(undef, pen),  # vx
    PencilArray{Float64}(undef, pen),  # vy
    PencilArray{Float64}(undef, pen),  # vz
)
summary(v⃗₀[1])

# We still need to fill this array with interesting values that represent a
# physical velocity field.

# ## Initial condition

# Let's set the initial condition in physical space.
# In this example, we choose the [Taylor--Green
# vortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%E2%80%93Green_vortex)
# configuration as an initial condition:
#
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# v_x(x, y, z) &=  u₀ \sin(k₀ x) \cos(k₀ y) \cos(k₀ z) \\
# v_y(x, y, z) &= -u₀ \cos(k₀ x) \sin(k₀ y) \cos(k₀ z) \\
# v_z(x, y, z) &= 0
# \end{aligned}
# ```
#
# where ``u₀`` and ``k₀`` are two parameters setting the amplitude and the
# period of the velocity field.
#
# To set the initial condition, each MPI process needs to know which portion of
# the physical grid it has been attributed.
# For this, PencilArrays.jl includes a
# [`localgrid`](https://jipolanco.github.io/PencilArrays.jl/dev/LocalGrids/#PencilArrays.LocalGrids.localgrid)
# helper function:

grid = localgrid(pen, xs_global)

# We can use this to initialise the velocity field:

u₀ = 1.0
k₀ = 2π / Ls[1]  # should be integer if L = 2π (to preserve periodicity)

@. v⃗₀[1] =  u₀ * sin(k₀ * grid.x) * cos(k₀ * grid.y) * cos(k₀ * grid.z)
@. v⃗₀[2] = -u₀ * cos(k₀ * grid.x) * sin(k₀ * grid.y) * cos(k₀ * grid.z)
@. v⃗₀[3] =  0
nothing # hide

# Let's plot a 2D slice of the velocity field managed by the local MPI process:

# ## Velocity in Fourier space
#
# In the Fourier pseudo-spectral method, the periodic velocity field is
# discretised in space as a truncated Fourier series
#
# ```math
# \bm{v}(\bm{x}, t) =
# ∑_{\bm{k}} \hat{\bm{v}}_{\bm{k}}(t) \, e^{i \bm{k} ⋅ \bm{x}},
# ```
#
# where ``\bm{k} = (k_x, k_y, k_z)`` are the discrete wave numbers.
#
# The wave numbers can be obtained using the
# [`fftfreq`](https://juliamath.github.io/AbstractFFTs.jl/dev/api/#AbstractFFTs.fftfreq)
# function.
# Since we perform a real-to-complex transform along the first dimension, we use
# [`rfftfreq`](https://juliamath.github.io/AbstractFFTs.jl/dev/api/#AbstractFFTs.rfftfreq) instead for ``k_x``:

using AbstractFFTs: fftfreq, rfftfreq

ks_global = (
    rfftfreq(Ns[1], 2π * Ns[1] / Ls[1]),  # kx | real-to-complex
     fftfreq(Ns[2], 2π * Ns[2] / Ls[2]),  # ky | complex-to-complex
     fftfreq(Ns[3], 2π * Ns[3] / Ls[3]),  # kz | complex-to-complex
)

ks_global[1]'
#
ks_global[2]'
#
ks_global[3]'

# To transform the velocity field to Fourier space, we first create a
# real-to-complex FFT plan to be applied to one of the velocity components:

plan = PencilFFTPlan(v⃗₀[1], Transforms.RFFT())

# See [`PencilFFTPlan`](@ref) for details on creating plans and on optional
# keyword arguments.
#
# We can now apply this plan to the three velocity components to obtain the
# respective Fourier coefficients ``\hat{\bm{v}}_{\bm{k}}``:

v̂s = plan .* v⃗₀
summary(v̂s[1])

# Note that, in Fourier space, the domain decomposition is performed along the
# directions ``x`` and ``y``:

pencil(v̂s[1])

# This is because the 3D FFTs are performed one dimension at a time, with the
# ``x`` direction first and the ``z`` direction last.
# To efficiently perform an FFT along a given direction (taking advantage of
# serial FFT implementations like FFTW), all the data along that direction must
# be contained locally within a single MPI process.
# For that reason, data redistributions (or *transpositions*) among MPI
# processes are performed behind the scenes during each FFT computation.
# Such transpositions require important communications between MPI processes,
# and are usually the most time-consuming aspect of massively-parallel
# simulations using this kind of methods.
#
# To solve the Navier--Stokes equations in Fourier space, we will
# also need the respective wave numbers ``\bm{k}`` associated to the local MPI
# process.
# Similarly to the local grid points, these are obtained using the `localgrid`
# function:

grid_fourier = localgrid(v̂s[1], ks_global)

# As an example, let's first use this to compute and plot the vorticity
# associated to the initial condition.
# The vorticity is defined as the curl of the velocity,
# ``\bm{ω} = \bm{∇} × \bm{v}``.
# In Fourier space, this becomes ``\hat{\bm{ω}} = i \bm{k} × \hat{\bm{v}}``.

# ## Computing the non-linear term
#
# One can show that, in Fourier space, the incompressible Navier--Stokes
# equations can be written as
#
# ```math
# ∂_t \hat{\bm{v}}_{\bm{k}} =
# - \mathcal{P}_{\bm{k}} \! \left[ \widehat{(\bm{v} ⋅ \bm{∇}) \bm{v}} \right]
# - ν |\bm{k}|^2 \hat{\bm{v}}_{\bm{k}}
# \quad \text{ with } \quad
# \mathcal{P}_{\bm{k}}(\hat{\bm{F}}_{\bm{k}}) = \left( I - \frac{\bm{k} ⊗
# \bm{k}}{|\bm{k}|^2} \right) \hat{\bm{F}}_{\bm{k}},
# ```
#
# where ``\mathcal{P}_{\bm{k}}`` is a projection operator allowing to preserve the
# incompressibility condition ``\bm{∇} ⋅ \bm{v} = 0``.
# This operator encodes the action of the pressure gradient term, which serves
# precisely to enforce incompressibility.
# Note that, because of this, the pressure gradient dissapears from the
# equations.
#
# Now that we have the wave numbers ``\bm{k}``, computing the linear viscous
# term in Fourier space is straighforward once we have the Fourier coefficients
# ``\hat{\bm{v}}_{\bm{k}}`` of the velocity field.
# What is slightly more challenging (and much more costly) is the computation of
# the non-linear term in Fourier space, ``\hat{\bm{F}}_{\bm{k}} =
# \left[ \widehat{(\bm{v} ⋅ \bm{∇}) \bm{v}} \right]_{\bm{k}}``.
# In the pseudo-spectral method, the quadratic nonlinearity is computed
# by collocation in physical space (i.e. this term is evaluated at grid points),
# while derivatives are computed in Fourier space.
# This requires transforming fields back and forth between both spaces.
#
# Below we implement a function that computes the non-linear term in Fourier
# space based on its convective form ``(\bm{v} ⋅ \bm{∇}) \bm{v} = \bm{∇} ⋅
# (\bm{v} ⊗ \bm{v})``.
# Note that this equivalence uses the incompressibility condition ``\bm{∇} ⋅ \bm{v} = 0``.
