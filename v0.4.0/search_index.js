Each element must be a subtype of Transforms.AbstractTransform. For all the possible transforms, see Transform types. Alternatively, transforms may be a single transform that will be automatically expanded into N equivalent transforms. This is illustrated in the example below.\n\nThe transforms are applied one dimension at a time, with the leftmost dimension first for forward transforms. For multidimensional transforms of real data, this means that a real-to-complex transform must be performed along the first dimension, and then complex-to-complex transforms are performed along the other two dimensions (see example below).\n\nThe data is distributed over the MPI processes in the comm communicator. The distribution is performed over M dimensions (with M < N) according to the values in proc_dims, which specifies the number of MPI processes to put along each dimension.\n\nOptional arguments\n\nThe floating point precision can be selected by setting real_type parameter, which is Float64 by default.\nextra_dims may be used to specify the sizes of one or more extra dimensions that should not be transformed. These dimensions will be added to the rightmost (i.e. slowest) indices of the arrays.\nNOTE: One possible application of extra_dims is for describing the components of a vector or tensor field. However, this means that different PencilFFTPlans would need to be created for each kind of field (scalar, vector, ...). To avoid the creation of multiple plans, a better alternative is to create tuples or arrays of PencilArrays using allocate_input and allocate_output.\nThe keyword arguments fftw_flags and fftw_timelimit are passed to the FFTW plan creation functions (see AbstractFFTs docs).\npermute_dims determines whether the indices of the output data should be reversed. For instance, if the input data has global dimensions (Nx, Ny, Nz), then the output of a complex-to-complex FFT would have dimensions (Nz, Ny, Nx). This enables FFTs to always be performed along the first (i.e. fastest) array dimension, which could lead to performance gains. This option is enabled by default. For type inference reasons, it must be a value type (Val(true) or Val(false)).\ntranspose_method allows to select between implementations of the global data transpositions. See the transpose! docs for details.\ntimer should be a TimerOutput object. See Measuring performance for details.\n\nExample\n\nSuppose we want to perform a 3D transform of real data.
